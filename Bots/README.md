# BOTS
Each 'bot' folder contains files and code that act as a independent sub-system. Each one uses aspects from the general libraries and components, but do not interact with each other [probably not completely true, TBD]. Below will be a synopsis of the current state of each bot for accurate record keeping.

## Arbitrage
Database changes need to be imported, balancing is still a work in progress

## Coin-Categorizer
Main logic needs work, test file needs to be created and test CSV file needs to be developed

## Fund-Manager
Look through files and correct/clean up, finish ProfitTracker, start ProfitLiquidator

## Market-Tracker
Visit all files, re-name and re-organize, set-up polling again

## MA-Trader
Hash our skeleton more in depth, better to-do list and planning
