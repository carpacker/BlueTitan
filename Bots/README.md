# BOTS
Each 'bot' folder contains files and code that act as a independent sub-system. Each one uses aspects from the general libraries and components, but typically do not interact with each other. Below will be a synopsis of the current state of each bot for accurate record keeping. The shorthand format for each component is as follows:
