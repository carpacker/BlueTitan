Home to all functionality pertaining to the arbitrage system.

# Theory

# Market Arbitrage

# Limit Arbitrage

# Main VS Theoretical
Main constitutes the primary runtime file while theoretical mostly mimics the runtime file but with more comments, descriptions
and work-in-progress items.


# TODO
Last thing I was on was most of ArbitrageMain
Then port those over to ArbitrageTheoretical
Then move onto work on the libraries

Some notes:
Thinking about abstracting the init into a higher level object, database stuff doesn't happen in the actual arbitrage, or at least some of it doesn't.
Definitely going to want to clean up the init and move things
A flowchart demonstrating how to thread the processes (profit tracker, arbitrage) could be helpful.
Plan for threading, arbitrage and shit, later...

* [ ] - sys paths for each thing
