'''
GDAX API
    CB-ACCESS-KEY The api key as a string.
    CB-ACCESS-SIGN The base64-encoded signature (see Signing a Message).
    CB-ACCESS-TIMESTAMP A timestamp for your request.
    CB-ACCESS-PASSPHRASE The passphrase you specified when creating the API key.

400 	Bad Request – Invalid request format
401 	Unauthorized – Invalid API Key
403 	Forbidden – You do not have access to the requested resource
404 	Not Found
500 	Internal Server Error – We had a problem with our server
429		Too many requests
		REQUEST rate limit
			public - 3 per second
			private - 5 per second

The CB-ACCESS-SIGN header is generated by creating a sha256 HMAC using the base64-decoded secret key 
on the prehash string timestamp + method + requestPath + body (where + represents string concatenation)
 and base64-encode the output. The timestamp value is the same as the CB-ACCESS-TIMESTAMP header.

The body is the request body string or omitted if there is no request body (typically for GET requests).

The method should be UPPER CASE.

EXAMPLE IN JAVA
var crypto = require('crypto');

var secret = 'PYPd1Hv4J6/7x...';

var timestamp = Date.now() / 1000;
var requestPath = '/orders';

var body = JSON.stringify({
    price: '1.0',
    size: '1.0',
    side: 'buy',
    product_id: 'BTC-USD'
});

var method = 'POST';

// create the prehash string by concatenating required parts
var what = timestamp + method + requestPath + body;

// decode the base64 secret
var key = Buffer(secret, 'base64');

// create a sha256 hmac with the secret
var hmac = crypto.createHmac('sha256', key);

// sign the require message with the hmac
// and finally base64 encode the result
return hmac.update(what).digest('base64');
-------------------------------------------------------------------
The CB-ACCESS-TIMESTAMP header MUST be number of seconds since Unix Epoch in UTC. Decimal values are allowed.

Your timestamp must be within 30 seconds of the api service time or your request will be considered expired and rejected.
 We recommend using the time endpoint to query for the API server time if you believe there many be time skew between your 
 server and the API servers.
