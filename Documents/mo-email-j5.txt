Hey,

I ended up getting quite a bit of stuff together as I was managing the workload. I have ordered
things as logically as I can perceive, some things may not make sense without looking at specific
files that are on GitHub or elsewhere. When that is the case, there will be a mention of what to
look at and where it is. Sorry this took so long and take your time to read through things.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Branding

I have been making an effort to consolidate what we have, solidify in practical terms what we want
and otherwise package our business into something that is easier to understand across the board.
A word one could use is rebranding, but we didn't really have much of a brand to begin with, so I
believe this stage would be considered branding. My focus has been on concise, central scheduling
and organization, systems for smooth transparency and analysis, establishing a consistent workflow
of goal-directed actions and modeling the business like an 'empire'.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
** Scheduling, Organization

I have reasoned that, especially in regards to delaying the move, that we must enter a new stage of
planning. What we were doing up until now was not enough. If we truly want to succeed to the degree
that I believe is within our capabilities, I've decided that a significant amount of effort must
go into streamlining organization and scheduling.

As I've mentioned, I started learning and consequently adopted a new, powerful text editor called
emacs. That move fell into the category of necessary optimizations to allow for streamlined
workflow. Emacs has a mode called 'org' mode which acts as an expansive planner. It will be
difficult to explain the ins and outs, I will instead show you how 'org' mode works over skype
sometime.

I have started towards keeping org documents as the master planners for our projects. Each project
has its own org doc where information is stored and tracked. This includes to-dos, deadlines, notes
and more. Org mode will be an invaluable tool for us. While you do not need to learn how to use it,
I want to show you what it looks like and why they are useful.

Working my organizational patterns into org-mode has been a big reason as to why this has taken so
long. The good news is that I'm basically done with the structure and from here it is just building.
I've been using org mode to plan much more than our projects.

On that front, so you know, my current schedule involves a workday of 8am to 4pm on the weekdays.
I have not set a consistent schedule yet for the weekends, but I will be doing something of a half
day. That gives me 40-48 hours a week to work on our projects. I typically try to work on one or
two things a day and will vary it up with personal projects.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
** Accountability, Analysis

The ability to process, analyze and understand a situation is an essential skill for us to have. The
best way to highlight this topic is through the lens of 'profit'. However, it is actually much bigger
than a dollar sign.

Let's look at profit-tracking in the lens of what we have been doing, what we currently can do and
what efforts have been completed thpat augment this ability. Then we will look at what we would
want to do in order to maintain acceptable, somewhat efficient levels of profit-tracking. First
we will assess mining, then the general fund-management.

For mining, we mine a currency and it gets sent directly to an address. As long as we keep it on
that address, its easy to track the proceeds. If we move it off, to anywhere else, record keeping
is required in order to maintain an accurate balance. However, more complicated is the costs that
are incurred. The initial sunk costs are straight forward: the price of the underlying components.
Electricity is a bit harder to determine for a couple reasons. First, it is currently going through
my dad, second, because we don't know how to accurately estimate the costs at runtime.

That is okay and provides us some level of understanding of our current profits, but I think we can
both agree that it is not complete and therefore, not acceptable. This is because we can't produce
even a final estimate of how much we've made, only the revenue. Additionally, we have issues in
earlier transactions where we sent funds to an exchange.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*** Mining

The desired functionality for the ability to track profits of our mining operations becomes clear
when we assess it in this manner. First, we need to be able to work through our previous issues.
Second, we need to have systems in place in order to circumvent the above issues. Generally,
what is required is

    1. Ability to track direct revenue (in terms of asset)
    2. Centralized record keeping of sunk costs
    3. Tracking the value of transactions between addresses and exchanges
    4. Recording and processing the cost of electricity

The bottom line is that we need to do the above for the past and the future. Processing the past
may be a bit time consuming. However, since we have outlined what is necessary to able to account
our total profits day to day, we will be able to design a system that reduces further strain.

I will take it one step further and outline a few steps that would be ideal for an optimal setup,
but would not be appropiate to implement until the above is implemented. Additionally, we may have
more to look at and items to add to the list once the above has been complete. For the sake of
keeping things simple, I won't outline the benefits of the below functionalities.

     1. Ability to track USD value day to day
     2. Calculating the opportunity cost of mining against of assets
     3. Calculating the depreciating value of our GPUs as they get used to mine

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*** Fund-Management

There are two items to look at in terms of fund management. First, there is bot related activities,
then there is change in value of the fund where the bot has no action. In the future, due to the
intended encompassing nature of the management system, the value will be completely tied to the
bot's performance. For now, we have to account for change in value due to outside force, and human
error.

To keep things simple, when looking at fund management outside of the bot, we assess two things.
First, we look at the change in value due to relatively long term decisions, for example the
decision to be mostly short or mostly long on the market. Then we look at change in value due to
short term decisions, like trading. The intent is to determine the value and the profit of the fund
day to day, and then to accurately account and asses our performance. The long term decisions amount
to assessing valuation over time, where trading would look at more nuanced decisions and items like
aggregate fees.

Currently, we do none of this, we merely hold some assets that I think are okay to hold. Not
completely random, but not directed, and certainly not an acceptable management state.

As for what to do, or what systems need to be in place in order to enact these decisions and then
observe the results, there is a wide range of actions. I will start the conversation with ideas that
I have, then we can deliberate until we find the right fit. Generally however, first we need to be
able to make both types of decisions, then we need to be able to review those decisions, then we
will need to be able to adapt to the result of those decisions. Easier said than done, here is a
short list by topic:

    1. Joint decision making on fund allocation based on market condition
    2. Period of time as reference for decision making
    3. Regular mettings to discuss direction of fund and its value
    4. Short term trading strategies

Onto the tracking the profitability of automated trading. A bit easier to track, since the program
will be explicitly keeping records of its transactions. But, its an important conceptual
distinction. The profitability of the program is one of the most important things for us to
analyze. It provides us with the basis for our company, it is what would differentiate us from
others. What matters is that we are able to keep tracking of the profit day to day of the entire
system, distinguish human error from program error and [once it becomes this complex] keep track
of the profit of different algorithms in isolation.

Currently, we keep track of all transactions, meaning we can track the increase in value based off
a trade. What we can't track is the change in value based on the choice of asset, which would play
into the profit of the algorithm.

To label explicitly what functionality would be required for adequate profit tracking and value
assessment:

    1. Profit tracking of program based on actions of an algorithm
    2. Accounting for change in value of asset against trade revenue
    3. Total profit tracking of the system
    4. Opportunity cost of running one algorithm against another
    5. Centralized record keeping of valuation of fund
    
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
***  Value of Current State

What is more important to me is the ability to track our total value, our intellectual capital...
whatever word you want to use for the work we put in over time. That's everything, documents,
meetings, messages. Having some way to establish metrics for the value of our work, outside of
profit is an invaluable resource. Don't get me wrong, profit is one of the more meaningful metrics.
However, especially in this early stage, we're going to want to look to other things as anchors
to progress. This then allows us to validate our actions. We know we are making progress, because
we have some way to see results. I don't think we have done enough of this for ourselves, we know
we should keep track of how much money we have, but beyond that there isn't much.

For example, these are some metrics I use to determine how much work I am putting in: GitHub
check boxes, number of commits, number of lines of code written. If we were to record every hour we
spend working on the project, that would be another metric.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
** Goal-directed Actions

These ideas are only useful to us when we are able to effectively apply them to scenarios. In
isolation they are meaningless. I will use the BlueTitan trading system and fund management as a
lens to understand how we should be acting. We should be setting goals and defining what actions
need to be done in order to reach those goals. Next, we adapt the goals (and subsequent actions)
over time as previous actions may alter these goals (or other events occur). Finally, we reflect on
results and the progress towards goals, evaluating our performance over time.

The two goals I think we should be focusing on are the program, specifically developing a
distinguishable prototype of the program and fund management. Centering our actions around these
topic I believe is our best option.

The shift I am enacting for the bot involves working on the bot using versions. A mistake in the
past has been altering the source code and rendering the bot unable to run, since part of it is
being worked on. From now on, there will be prototype versions at every step of the way. These
versions will be designed with  certain features before being considered complete and progress
can be made towards designing and completing the next version of the prototype. This makes the
project act in cycles, rather than in a straight line. Progress is detailed in a later section.
Thus, each specific task can be executed with a short-term mindset (towards the prototype version)
and each prototype version can be executed with a long-term mindset.

I do not have as much to say about fund management, other than I believe we should move to adopt
that as our primary joint action. I will just update you on the bot and other things, you don't
need to have any significant input on the menial thing. This is because we already agree on
most big picture items. Shifting our focus on trading and managing the fund would be a good segue
for us to be able to establish a fund.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
** 'empire' attitude

I'm going to do this saturday morning
- Varying projects within a realm
- Role of components as a consistent base
- Re-applying proven models

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I might be tempted to label this our manifesto. From here, I have practical updates. As I was
working on these things and the practical updates, I decided to write the above. To wrap things
up in a conclusion, those are the things that I believe are most important going forward based
on my perception of what we have been doing, what we are doing and what we could be doing. While
I think that everything has been appropiate up until this point, in other words my suggestion of
the following does not imply that this has not been going on, I would like to encourage you to
develop documents in a similar manner based on your perception of our current state, what we can
do, what you think we should do and what you would like to do. To be blunt, you are never going
to quit your job as long as you don't have something to do in its place that offers a greater
opportunity cost. That is the nature of life, and I think that is the appropiate way to manage
the situation. If you want to quit your job and pursue an entrepeneurial venture, you may want to
consider viewing your options in this manner. I believe I am a good person for you to bounce ideas
off of. I am writing this in part because it does just that for myself. I feel the need to validate
the opportunity cost of our actions. Writing things like the above, robust planning and constant
evaluation are key to that intent. I am dedicated to building something greater and I think the two
of us are poised to do so, if we are so inclined. We can have another conversation about evaluating
the opportunity cost at another point. I have spent alot of time thinking about it and may be able
to offer you productive insight.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Current Bot Work

I will run through a short update of what I am currently working on. I run through specific tasks
in greater detail below in the calendar section. Generally, this is what is being worked on in
general order of importance:

    1. File Organization
    2. Complete Market Arbitrage Capabilities 
    3. Automatic Balancing with error handling
    4. Generalized Database Implementation
    5. System Controller
    6. Server Runtime
    7. Profit Tracking & Metrics
    8. Basic Liquidation
    
These are being worked on simultaneously, descriptions of each can be found in the prototype doc.
This is called proto-v1.txt in Documents/Prototyping. These are the items that must be finished
in order for the bot to run in its first prototype stage.

The ORG doc containing the expansive TODO list for the BlueTitan project can be found in the
Documents folder on the GitHub. Its also a work in progress, but there's quite a bit there already.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Updates on Antony

I've been working with Antony for a few weeks. I will go over the project idea and will update you
occasionally. At some point we will have a meeting between three of us. He is down for the project
and I will go over by voice what the situation is.

We're developing an algorithm that uses the moving average (or something similar) to trade off of.
It is a high frequency strategy which would ideally be run side by side the arbitrage in the
future. You can get an idea of what's going on by checking out the github.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* 3 Month Calendar

I'm developing  a three month calendar with deadlines for projects to help us move forward. It
includeswill include a variety of things. It will be found in the Documents folder on the GitHub.
It is more of a guideline than it is an absolute decree. It mostly pertains to the software and
was designed with the conceptual topics I went over earlier in mind. It will be in the form of an
ORG doc which I mentioned. I'm stil working on it so the document isn't there yet.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Balances

The current tally of our total balance in terms by asset and in terms of USD can be found in the
balances.txt file. I am working on a more robust way to track balances from day to day that I will
get back to you on. Note that this isn't a valuation of profit, just what we currently have as
holdings

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Conclusion

Take your time to read and process the above. Get back to me when you have collected your thoughts.
I want to say that you don't necessarily need to have a response to most of this, I'm not trying to
sell you on anything. The purpose of this was to communicate the current state of operations in
depth and provide a conceptual basis for the actions that I am taking. Input and conversation is
obviously welcome and important, but you do not necessarily need to have a response as long as
you understand it and are on the same page.

Sorry this took so long. I think delaying the move was the right choice. These things need to get
done before we move. Also I didn't proofread this, already spent too much time writing it.
