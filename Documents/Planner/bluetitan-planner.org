+ Resume runtime testing
+ Profit Liquidation
+ Complete balancing

* General

** Organization
All meta-organizational items such as readmes, todo lists and scheduling.

** READMEs
*** TODO Write general format for readmes by directory
** Planner
** Prototyping
*** TODO Re-structure prototype document
    
** Document

** Arbitrage
*** General
Big tasks
 + Reworking profit tracking in relation to performing withdrawals
 + Laying own limit arbitrage foundation
 + Add error tracking via PrintLibrary
Specific tasks
 + Rework decideOrder
 + Rework determineOrdersize
 + Generic checkMinOrder
 + Skeleton functions for limit arbitrage in arbitrage library
 + PrintLibrary message function

Arbitrage
 + if arbitrage_quantity == 0 error @ ~320
 + determineOrderSize variable quantity/ratio...
   + allow for scaling
   + possible neural network
 + evaluatePairing comments
 + Reworking getAggregateWFees
   + Possibly replace the function
   + Break into small parts

*** Balancing
+ Vetting and reworking file
+ Adding in changes to database library and all that
+ Possibly integrating into arbitrage library
+ Possibly move parts to fund manager
+ Test last loop buildCurrentFAE
+ Run through balancePairings
+ BalancePairing storeEntry actual values
+ Move tag check
** Coin-Categorizer
** Fund-Manager

*** TODO :: general
   - Review Metrics, bunch of inputs don't match up
   - Make variables more clear (assign names instead)
   - Generalize/partition parts of code
   - Implement 'running algorithms'

   - Clean up, move around runHourly/daily
*** TODO :: by function
** Market-Tracker
** Performance-Tracker
** System-Controller
*** TODO
+ Rework the clean database portion
+ Fix class balance_dict print
+ Helpers writeconvert pairing to asset list
* Components

*** TODO :: general
   - Moving databases to their own folderu
   - Retrieval using uuid
   - Uuid creation
   - Uuid insertion
*** TODO :: by function
   - getEntry/getEntries
   - deleteEntry
   - deleteEntries

*** TODO :: test
   - createUuid
   - Base tester flow
** Front-End

** Mining
*** TODO : immediate
   - Test autostart.sh
   - Overclock 1 gpu
   - List of GPUs, default, ideal settings in github
   - Port settings to github
*** Tidbits
   Initial set up for a rig :: Starts after the below maintenance sweep
   - Pre-requisite packages installed (todo compile list)
   - autostart, clear logs, mine-start scripts set up
   - Settings filled out
   - Names/passwords set according to existing organizational scheme.

   Maintenance flow for updating rigs
   - Update ubuntu (re-install if necessary)
   - Download latest mining version; test each with old drivers
   - Download new video drivers, uninstall old ones; install new ones
   - Test mining with new drivers; revert if they don't work
