Last thing I was doing was Coinbase Auth...
Need to get those keys, write the two relevant account/transaction functions
Then I need to test them, put those functions in a specific tester
Finally, as far as API goes (for now...) I standardize the output across them

Next, I revisit profitlosscalculator, specifically finishing the first two sections.
The known issues are: matching up addresses with exchanges and sorting the lists properly (including cut off date)
Once those and whatever other issues are resolved, then its adapting the actual calculator one final time using value.
Finally, there is the testing of the values until a good rough estimate is done.

The last steps are verification, making sure the number is right, and then possibly adding Bittrex/Binance
With final CSV, will have records and all that
