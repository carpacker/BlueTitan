   exchange-records - Contains all data that can be classified as a record on an exchange. This
                       includes trades, withdrawals, deposits and transfers. Each exchange gets
                       three tables, one for withdrawals, one for deposits and one for trades.

   historical-data  - Contains a list of tables that contain historical-data for each currency
                       that is designated to be tracked. Each currency has its own table where
                       each entry contains data pertinent to a period in time.
   running-data     - The same as above, but instead data captured by our own program rather
                       than scraped from an external site.
   mining-records   - Contains data pertinent to mining, specifically records and performance.
