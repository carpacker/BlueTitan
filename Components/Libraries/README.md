The libraries folder contains set of python scripts containing relevant general libraries. These libraries are used by many bots and components and aren't specifically tuned for any one sub-system. It currently consists of a general 'Helpers' library, containing various functions to cut down on lines of code and to simplify repetitive actions everywhere, PrintLibrary to aid in debugging and SortingLibrary which contains a useful set of sorting algorithms read-at-hand.

# Helpers
Mostly needs a little clean up, potentially re-partitioning functions into smaller subsets as it grows larger.

# PrintLibrary
* [ ] - Add in some more flavor functions
* [ ] - Dynamic printing
* [ ] - Orderbook print
* [ ] - More robust inputs for many prints

# SortingLibrary
Mostly unfinished, work in progress
