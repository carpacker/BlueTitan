I need to take some notes on how a script will manage wallets/have the ability to send funds and all that

There needs to be a writeup of the update/standardization technique for each rig. This will be summarized in a todo list to start, but will need to be formalized at some point. These actions will include updating software, adding necessary scripts and adjusting settings for the sake of optimization. Each rig will also have standardized information such as name and ip.

For the current rig I need to read the bookmarked rig guide, need to find it lol, and follow it to overclock 1 gpu.
